# OpenPoke 🌴

test
OpenPoke is a simplified, open-source take on [Interaction Company’s](https://interaction.co/about) [Poke](https://poke.com/) assistant—built to show how a multi-agent orchestration stack can feel genuinely useful. It keeps the handful of things Poke is great at (email triage, reminders, and persistent agents) while staying easy to spin up locally.

- Multi-agent FastAPI backend that mirrors Poke's interaction/execution split, powered by OpenAI-compatible APIs.
- Gmail tooling via [Composio](https://composio.dev/) for drafting/replying/forwarding without leaving chat.
- Trigger scheduler and background watchers for reminders and "important email" alerts.
- Next.js web UI that proxies everything through the shared `.env`, so plugging in API keys is the only setup.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

## Quickstart
1. **Clone and enter the repo.**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shlokkhemani/OpenPoke
   cd OpenPoke
   ```
2. **Create a shared env file.** Copy the template and open it in your editor:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. **Get your API keys and add them to `.env`:**
   
   **API Configuration (Required)**
   - Configure your OpenAI-compatible API endpoint and API key in `.env`
   - Set `API_BASE_URL` to your API endpoint (e.g., `https://api.friendli.ai/dedicated/v1`)
   - Set `API_KEY` to your API key
   - All agent models can be configured via environment variables
   
   **Composio (Required for Gmail)**
   - Sign in at [composio.dev](https://composio.dev/)
   - Create an API key
   - Set up Gmail integration and get your auth config ID
   - Replace `your_composio_api_key_here` and `your_gmail_auth_config_id_here` in `.env`

## 🚀 Quick Start (Docker - Recommended)

If you have Docker and docker-compose installed, you can get started immediately:

```bash
# Deploy with one command
./deploy.sh

# Or manually
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This will start both the API server (port 8001) and web UI (port 3000).

## 🛠️ Manual Setup (Alternative)

4. **(Required) Create and activate a Python 3.10+ virtualenv:**
   ```bash
   # Ensure you're using Python 3.10+
   python3.10 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   
   # Verify Python version (should show 3.10+)
   python --version
   ```
   On Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   # Use Python 3.10+ (adjust path as needed)
   python3.10 -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   
   # Verify Python version
   python --version
   ```

5. **Install backend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r server/requirements.txt
   ```
6. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install --prefix web
   ```
7. **Start the FastAPI server:**
   ```bash
   python -m server.server --reload
   ```
8. **Start the Next.js app (new terminal):**
   ```bash
   npm run dev --prefix web
   ```
9. **Connect Gmail for email workflows.** With both services running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), head to *Settings → Gmail*, and complete the Composio OAuth flow. This step is required for email drafting, replies, and the important-email monitor.

The web app proxies API calls to the Python server using the values in `.env`, so keeping both processes running is required for end-to-end flows.
